> **Where crypto gets social.** Join the community. Hold the token. Unlock the experience.

## What We're building

The first social-native crypto platform where communities form around tokens, not just invest in them. Amazing social infrastructure that transforms how crypto communities connect and collaborate.
The platform will have different badges and NFT's polygon powered. A member will unlock more priviledges depending on the badge that he has minted. Later on we will implement .fame which will represnt a certain members who have reached a certain milestone in the platform.
